    <div class = "content1">"IoT based Emergency Vehicle Detection using YOLOv8 Algorithm"  in the Journal of Automation, Mobile Robotics and Intelligent Systems [JAMRIS]</div>
    <p class="p">Paper highlights the significance of quick emergency service response in saving lives and reducing the impact of crises. It focuses on the use of the You Only Look Once version 8 (YOLOv8) algorithm in identifying emergency vehicles in real-time, particularly in congested urban areas. The system, implemented on a Raspberry Pi acting as an edge device, captures live video through an IoT device with a camera. </p>
    <p class="p">Upon detecting an emergency vehicle, the system sends an email notification to nearby emergency services through SMTP for prompt action. The research demonstrates the system's ability to recognize emergency vehicles at 31 frames per second with a 95% accuracy rate. It emphasizes the potential of IoT and machine learning in creating effective, low-cost, and adaptable emergency vehicle detection systems, which could significantly improve emergency response efficiency and ultimately save lives. Further enhancements may involve incorporating more advanced machine learning algorithms and additional sensors beyond camera-based detection for improved efficacy.</p>
